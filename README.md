# 🧩 Sudoku Solver in Java  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **Sudoku Solver** built in **Java** using the **Backtracking Algorithm**.  
It takes a `9x9` Sudoku puzzle as input (with `0` representing empty cells) and solves it step by step using recursion and constraint checking.  

## ⚡ Features  
- ✅ Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle  
- ✅ Uses **Backtracking + Recursion** for efficient solving  
- ✅ Console-based user input for interactive solving  
- ✅ Prints the solved board in a clean format  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Java ☕  
- **Concepts Used:** Backtracking, Recursion, 2D Arrays, Constraint Checking  

## 🖥️ How It Works  
1. Enter the Sudoku puzzle (row by row).  
2. Empty cells should be entered as `0`.  
3. The program will solve the puzzle and print the completed Sudoku grid.
